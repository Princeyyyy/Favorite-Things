        <p><strong>I'm going to teach you all about cars. First, we will start with why you should buy one:</strong></p>
        <div class="Buy">
            <p>Driving a car is important for people in general because it provides status and the opportunity for personal control and autonomy. In sparsely populated areas, owning a car is even more important, since it provides the only opportunity for travelling long distances due to a lack of public transport.Some more reasons why you hsould own a cra include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Reliability.</li>
                <li>Safety.</li>
                <li>Style.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Secondly, i'm going to tell you why you shouldn't buy a car.</strong></p>
        <div class="Not Buy">
            <p>The main reason people don't own cars is because  of the <span class="danger">dangers of Speeding</span>. As motorists often deal with a number of distractions and fast-paced traffic while driving, many find it easy to exceed the speed limit. However, speeding greatly increases the risk of causing a crash that results in serious injury or death.Some other reasons as to why you shouldn't buy a car are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Owning a Car is Inefficient.</li>
                    <li>Owning a Car is Expensive.</li>
                    <li>Freedom Because You Own a Car is an Illusion.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
